   <h1>Objective</h1>
        <p>Since 2010 I've been working in Accounting and Finance. Through that work I've found that my technical skills have given me the ability to 
        create real value in any organization.  Accounting and Finance introduced me to the power of data, coding, programming and building
        automated solutions.  I've studied and deployed solution for my Accounting and Finance teams in Excel, Power Query, Power Pivot, Power BI,
        Data Modeling, SQL and Python.  All of this has created a fascination with creating tools and programs using my programming skills. My main objective
        is to transition to a career as a software engineer or web developer.  I'm not exactly sure which direction this will take me yet, but I'm very 
        interested in Data Sciene, Web Development and Mobile App Development.
